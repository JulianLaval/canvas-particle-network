## Overview

In this experiment, I set out to build a simple, sexy, interactive, and animated particle network using Canvas and JavaScript. Fully plug n' play, modular (via Browserify and WebPack), and customisable, just drop it in any webpage.

[See it live on CodePen](http://codepen.io/JulianLaval/pen/KpLXOO/)

Alternatively, fork the repo and open `demo.html` to give it a whirl; the minified version comes in at just under a cheeky 4KB uncompressed, and 1.3KB when gzipped!

## Usage

The plugin is available as `canvas-particle-network` via Bower or NPM. Alternatively, you can simply clone this repository.

For a barebones implementation, simply add a HTML `div` to your body. You may specify its dimensions via CSS/JavaScript without any issues, as well as specify multiple instances. Then, simply add the JavaScript file to the end of your `body` and create a `ParticleNetwork` instance using your canvas ID.

```html
<body>
	<div id="particle-canvas"></div>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="particle-network.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		var particleCanvas = new ParticleNetwork(canvasDiv, options);
	</script>
</body>
```

Additionally, a number of options are supported (see below). Simply append any of these options to your arguments on creation.

```js
var options = {
	particleColor: '#fff',
	particleRadius: 1.5,
	lineWidth: 0.7,
	background: '#1a252f',
	interactive: true,
	speed: 'fast',
	density: 'medium'
};
var particleCanvas = new ParticleNetwork(document.getElementById('particle-canvas'), options);
```

## Options

#### options.particleColor

Type: `String`  
Default: `#ffffff`

Color of the particles. Must be a valid hexadecimal code.

#### options.particleRadius

Type: `Number`  
Default: `1.5`

Radius of the particles.

#### options.lineWidth

Type: `Number`  
Default: `0.7`

Width of the lines joining particles.

#### options.background

Type: `String`  
Default: `#1a252f`

Specifies a background color or image to the canvas. Must be a valid image URL (e.g. `img/demo-bg.jpg`) or hexadecimal code.

#### options.interactive

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `true`

Allow users to click on the canvas to create a new particle. Its velocity will depend on the specified speed (see below).

#### options.speed

Type: `String`  
Default: `medium`

Velocity of the particles. Must be one of the following:

* `none`
* `slow`
* `medium`
* `fast`

#### options.density

Type: `String` or `Number`  
Default: `medium` (alias for `10000`)

Density of the particles. Actual amount depends on the canvas size, and is calculate by dividing the total canvas size by the density. The following values are accepted:

* `low` (or `20000`)
* `medium` (or `10000`)
* `high` (or `5000`)
* Any number

Please note that the higher the density, the more computationally intensive / slower each animation step becomes!
